## SUMMARY:
 In race 1 and 2, I use the randrange and forward functions to move each turtle forward at a random length. For part B, I defined a function that takes in the desired side length and number of sides. Using the number of sides it calculates the interior angle length and draw the desired shape using the orange turtle. It clears the shape after each call as well.
